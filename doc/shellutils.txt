*INTRODUCTION*
                                                     *shellutils-introduction*

The |shellutils.vim| is a plugin that provides user-defined commands have
the shell-like functions from the cmd-line of Vim. We think the command line
of the shell as command line of Vim. Do not you think that's useful if you can
execute shell commands without changing the current buffer and also without 
exiting Vim?

*COMMANDS*

                                                                         *:Ls*
:Ls[!] [{path}]
        Show up some files in the {path} directory to cmd-line.
        If you want to show up all the files, including the files that begin
        with a dot in the {path} directory, then please put a bang. (|:Ls!|)
        If you omit the {path}, the current directory is specified as {path}.

                                                                       *:File*
:File [{path}]
        Display {path} file information to cmd-line.If the {path} argument is
        omitted, set current buffer as {path}. The |:File| display many file
        information such as 'ls -l' of shell. For example,

<
            \[file] rw-r--r-- 2014-08-15 17:02:58 (5KB) shellutils.txt
<
                                                                         *:Rm*
:Rm[!] [{path}]
        Remove the {path} file. If the {path} argument is omitted, remove the
        current buffer. The |:Rm| inquires whether you really delete the {path}
        file. If you don't do this, then please put a bang. (|:Rm!|)

                                                                      *:Mkdir*
:Mkdir {path}

        create directory(ies) when parent directory if no existing.

                                                                      *:Touch*

:Head {path}

:Tail {path}
